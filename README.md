# CSU-Global-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Code and final results for my MIS581 final capstone project dealing with a predictive maintenance model for the United States Army.

This project used a simulated dataset to analyze how effective Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data is at predicting unplanned maintenance events.

The dataset I used can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parvmodi/automotive-vehicles-engine-health-dataset.  Variables were renamed to make it easier to follow along.

Data cleaning and analysis was done in R and SAS.
